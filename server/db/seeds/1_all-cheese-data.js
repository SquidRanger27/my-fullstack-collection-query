Over 20 years on, they make 14 handcrafted cheeses using milk from their own ewes and from cows on nearby farms. Their cheeses consistently win awards. From the beginning, sustainability has been a core value, and Kingsmeade is a previous winner of the Wellington on a Plate Sustainability Award. This classic soft white cheese style originated in the French Ile-de-France region. The white crust protects the cheese from drying out and speeds up the ripening process. The texture can vary from slightly grainy to runny, and the flavour can range from mild to a powerful mushroom taste, sometimes with a slight hint of pepper. Factory made brie tends to have a thick crust, but artisan brie has a thin crust blotched with yellow or grey patches of mould. Kingsmeade Ngawi Brie is a stunning take on this classic style, using cow’s milk. It is soft, wonderfully creamy and oozing, and redolent of mushrooms, and definitely has a thin, blotchy crust.`,

Gouda is a Dutch semi-hard to hard cheese made from cow’s milk and named after the city where it was originally traded. Meyer’s Vintage Gouda is a spectacular example of the style. It has a crumbly texture with a strong, sharp flavour. Being an older cheese, it also features the trademark crystals on the surface and in the body of the cheese.

He was a professional rugby player in Italy, but also a senior executive for an international company. They couldn’t stay away from NZ and their growing group of friends, so eventually decided to migrate. Like The Cheese Wheel, they worked out that we lack a wide variety of quality cheese. Unsurprisingly, they homed in on a lack of local Italian styles. After lots of research they purchased a little cheesery in Nelson which brought with it an association with Oaklands Farm who supply traceable milk from A2 cows. They added an Italian cheesemaster to the mix and ecco domini! The name is a portmanteau of their first names of course, and their branding is completed with our local four stars of the Southern Cross. Just like “ViaVio”, Fontal is a portmanteau of Fontina and Emmental. Fontina is an Italian strong raw milk alpine cheese and Emmental a Swiss yellow, medium-hard cheese. This love child of two great styles is a pasteurized, semi-hard, washed rind cheese that is a little milder than Fontina, but still aromatic and buttery. ViaVio age theirs for 30 to 60 days. It also melts beautifully, so if you can find some wild mushrooms they’ll be even better with some Fontal melted on top.`,

Deer milk is currently only produced in small quantities in the South Island. One description is “perfectly smooth, astonishingly light, with exquisite flavour”, and this seems to be translating into deer cheese. This Deer Milk Gouda shows it’s been well worthwhile. It is unquestionably from deer, exhibiting musky tones under the classic gouda features. It’s distinctively white, and a little crumbly.

White cheese is formed by a combination of mould (Penicillium candidum, Penicillium camemberti), yeast, or yeast-like fungus (Geotrichum candidum) that blooms like tiny flowers on the exterior of a ripening cheese. Over time, these patches of yellowish white fur are patted down to form a cohesive skin, or rind, on the cheese’s surface. This live rind breaks down the fats and proteins of a cheese, causing an increasingly creamy to runny texture over time. This is why you may encounter that glistening layer just under the rind, which is called the creamline. The Nag has slight cabbage taste; its centre is light and fluffy. As this cheese matures it takes on a rich intense mushroomy flavour and the centre becomes more of a gooey paste. Cranky Goat cheese owner Simon Lamb has only been in the business for three years, having spent most of his earlier life jumping out of planes as a Royal Air Force Regiment parachutist.Together with his wife Hellene, and daughter Hannah, the trio are putting the Kenepuru Sound back on the cheese making map.

In the early 1880s, the king of Denmark asked Swiss cheesemakers to show Danish farmers how to make cheese. The early results were similar to Emmental, holes and all. Danbo is a milder version of those early cheeses, very popular in Demark. It is pale, has a very pleasant aroma and tastes slightly sweet and nutty. Sometimes it even has holes, albeit smaller than Emmental. The Hohepa Danbo is a perfect example of the style. Some say that Danbo goes well with cider, a pinot gris, an oaked chardonnay, or even a chianti. We know it goes superbly with a NZ amber or brown ale!`,
